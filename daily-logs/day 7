## Day 7 – Open Source Progress

### 🔹 What I did today
- Worked on multiple Python-based open source pull requests
- Prepared a clean, CI-safe contribution focused on documentation and readability
- Carefully refined code to meet repository style and linting standards
- Followed best practices for scope control and reviewer-friendly changes

### 🔹 What I learned
- Small, well-scoped Python changes have a higher chance of approval
- Understanding repository CI and linting rules is critical for successful PRs
- Clear docstrings and minimal diffs are appreciated by maintainers
- Reusing the same repository helps build contributor trust

### 🔹 Challenges faced
- Ensuring code changes comply with strict CI and formatting checks

### 🔹 How I solved / plan to solve them
- Reviewed existing code style before making changes
- Limited changes to documentation and readability improvements
- Waited for maintainer feedback before making further updates

### 🔹 Reflection
- I’m becoming more confident contributing to real-world Python repositories
- The PR workflow feels much more natural now
- I’m focused on building consistency rather than rushing large changes
