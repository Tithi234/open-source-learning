## Day 5 – Open Source Progress

### What I did today
- Prepared and submitted a documentation-focused pull request to a large, active open-source project
- Improved README clarity and contributor guidance
- Followed the complete PR workflow with careful scope control

### What I learned
- Large projects prefer small, focused documentation improvements
- Clear PR descriptions and limited scope reduce review friction
- Patience after opening a PR is part of open-source etiquette

### Challenges faced
- Deciding how much to improve without overstepping scope

### How I solved / plan to solve them
- Kept changes minimal and aligned with existing structure
- Focused on clarity rather than rewriting content

### Reflection
- I’m more confident contributing to mature repositories
- Ready to move forward with a small code-based PR next
