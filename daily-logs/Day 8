### Open Source Learning Log – Day 8

**Focus:** Stabilising contributions and understanding open-source workflows

#### What I worked on today
- Reviewed the current state of my open pull requests across repositories
- Identified which PRs are clean and CI-passing and which ones need to be left aside
- Learned how strict contribution templates and checklists are enforced in large repositories
- Refined my understanding of how maintainers and bots evaluate pull requests

#### What I learned
- Passing CI and following the contribution checklist is just as important as writing correct code
- Documentation-only changes must still follow repository guidelines strictly
- It is okay to close or ignore failing PRs instead of forcing fixes
- Quality, clarity, and patience matter more than the number of pull requests

#### Challenges faced
- Dealing with automated bot closures due to checklist and formatting issues
- Understanding when to stop opening new PRs and focus on cleanup

#### How I addressed them
- Read contribution guidelines more carefully before opening new PRs
- Decided to prioritise clean, review-ready Python PRs going forward
- Adjusted my plan to focus on consistency rather than rushing for numbers

#### Reflection
- Today helped me slow down and think like a contributor, not just an applicant
- I feel more confident navigating real open-source workflows
- Moving forward, I will focus on clean, intentional contributions
