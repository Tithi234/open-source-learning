## Day 6 – Open Source Progress

### 🔹 What I did today
- Opened a documentation-focused pull request on the first-contributions repository
- Improved the README by adding helpful tips for first-time contributors
- Followed the complete GitHub workflow: fork → edit → commit → pull request
- Practiced writing clean commit messages and PR descriptions

### 🔹 What I learned
- Small documentation improvements can significantly improve contributor experience
- Writing from a beginner’s perspective adds real value to open source projects
- Repeating the PR workflow increases confidence and reduces hesitation
- Clear and concise PR descriptions make reviews easier for maintainers

### 🔹 Challenges faced
- Deciding how much information is enough without over-editing the README

### 🔹 How I solved / plan to solve them
- Reviewed existing sections to maintain consistency
- Kept the changes minimal and aligned with the repository’s purpose

### 🔹 Reflection
- I feel more confident navigating open source repositories
- The PR process feels natural now instead of intimidating
- I’m ready to move from documentation contributions to small code-based PRs
