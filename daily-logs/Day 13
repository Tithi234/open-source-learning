### Open Source Learning Log – day 13

**Focus:** Finalizing and submitting a clean Python documentation pull request

#### What I worked on today
- Reviewed and finalized a Python implementation of the Greatest Common Divisor algorithm
- Improved and validated the module-level docstring for clarity and correctness
- Verified that the code structure, doctests, and type hints were correct
- Prepared and submitted a documentation-focused pull request following repository guidelines

#### What I learned
- Small documentation improvements still require careful structure and formatting
- Verifying module docstrings is essential to avoid syntax or CI issues
- Clear PR titles and accurate descriptions help maintainers review faster
- Following the PR checklist precisely prevents automated rejections

#### Challenges faced
- Ensuring the module docstring and formatting were correct and non-duplicated

#### How I addressed them
- Carefully reviewed the full file before committing
- Removed duplication and corrected formatting issues
- Followed a step-by-step PR process rather than rushing

#### Reflection
- Today reinforced the importance of precision and patience in open source contributions
- I feel more confident preparing PRs independently and validating them before submission
- My workflow is becoming more structured and professional
