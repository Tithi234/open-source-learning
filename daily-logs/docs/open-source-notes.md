# Open Source Notes

- Open source is collaborative development
- Contributions include documentation, code, testing, and reviews
- Small contributions are valuable
- Communication and consistency matter

## Goal
Prepare myself to contribute confidently to open source projects
and participate in GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC).
