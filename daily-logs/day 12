### Open Source Learning Log – Day 27

**Focus:** Maintaining contribution quality and executing a clean Python documentation PR

#### What I worked on today
- Identified an alternative Python file after encountering a missing path
- Prepared a documentation-focused pull request on an existing algorithm file
- Improved docstring clarity and minor typing/readability aspects
- Ensured the pull request followed repository contribution guidelines and checklist requirements

#### What I learned
- File paths and repository structure must always be verified before planning a PR
- Documentation and readability improvements are effective low-risk contributions
- Small, well-scoped changes are easier for maintainers to review
- Adapting quickly without forcing a plan is important in open source work

#### Challenges faced
- Original planned file was not present in the repository

#### How I addressed them
- Switched to an existing, suitable Python file without rushing
- Limited changes strictly to documentation and clarity
- Followed the PR checklist carefully to avoid automated issues

#### Reflection
- Today reinforced the importance of flexibility and calm execution
- I feel more confident navigating repository structures independently
- My open source workflow is becoming more disciplined and reliable
