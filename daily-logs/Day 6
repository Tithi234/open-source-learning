### Major highlight
- My first code-based pull request was approved by a maintainer in a large open-source repository

### What I learned
- Writing proper docstrings improves code quality
- CI failures are part of the process, not personal mistakes
- Clear communication with maintainers matters

### Reflection
- This boosted my confidence in contributing to real-world codebases
- I feel ready to take on slightly more complex issues next
