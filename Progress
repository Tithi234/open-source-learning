# 🌿 Open Source Learning — Transition Update

## From Algorithms to Real-World Contributions

Over the past few weeks, I focused heavily on contributing to
algorithm-based Python repositories. This phase helped me build:

- Strong familiarity with Git & GitHub workflows
- Experience handling CI failures and linters (Ruff, formatting checks)
- Understanding of contribution guidelines and structured PR templates
- Confidence in reading and improving existing code
- Discipline in writing clean pull requests

However, I realized that repeatedly working on algorithm-only repositories
was no longer contributing significantly to my growth.

Instead of chasing PR counts, I decided to pivot toward:

- Real-world Python repositories
- Issue-driven contributions
- Documentation improvements
- Beginner onboarding clarity
- Applied Python and data-related projects

This shift represents a move from:
"Practicing contribution mechanics"
to
"Creating meaningful and context-aware contributions."

## Key Lesson Learned

Not every PR needs to be merged for learning to happen.
Handling CI failures, revising scope, and deciding when to pivot
are all part of becoming a thoughtful open-source contributor.

## Current Focus

- Contributing to educational and real-world Python projects
- Creating issues before opening PRs
- Improving documentation and onboarding experience
- Building my own applied Python/Data Science project

This marks the beginning of a more intentional, impact-focused phase
of my open-source journey.
